Mendeley Desktop's Microsoft (MS) Word Plugin is difficult to work with when
compared with Endnote's Cite-While-You-Write Plugin. However, Mendeley Desktop
provides a more preferential user experience than Endnote does for citation
management and PDF annotation. Gratefully, Mendeley has provided an export
feature to Endnote. Simply select the records that need to go to Endnote and
select "Export" or command-E (macOS). Then ensure "Endnote" is the selected
export format (as opposed to .bib or RIS format). A common problem with
importing this output into Endnote is that the links to the PDFs are broken.
For those who do not even need/want the PDFs in Endnote anyway, this problem is
easily resolved by deleting the copies of the PDFs and removing the "links" to
them in the XML file. This script automates that process. Exporting and
importing must stil be done by hand.

For directions on how to run this software, simply run with the -h flag. Note
that the default file name for the XML file is "~/Desktop/My Collection.xml" and
the default directory for PDFs is "~/Desktop/My Collection.Data". Thus, if you
do not specify, -x and/or -d, the default values will be assumed.

Please see the `LICENSE' file.

Thank you.
